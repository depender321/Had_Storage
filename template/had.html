				<h2>WHY USE HAD STORAGE?</h2>
			</center>
			<br><br><br>
			<center>
				<h3 style="color: white;">
				LOVESPACE was the perfect solution for me whilst I was <br> moving in between houses. I simply took delivery of the <br> boxes, packed them and they were collected on moving <br> day. When I was settled into my new home, some 8 weeks <br> later, my boxes were delivered to my new house. I saved <br> money on expensive storage fees, didn’t need to hire a car <br> or van and I could organise everything online (usually on the bus to work).
